# simulate-paramecium
Simulate paramecium moving and eating food using pixel-based points in Python , with adjustable environment size, food generation rate, and other parameters defined in the constants at the beginning of the source code.

I'm going to use machine learning to improve the food searching and movement ability of paramecium.
I welcome others to participate in the project.
